# DiceGame

- Started as a codealong for Jonas Schnedtmann's udemy javascript course.  Challenged myself to code large parts of the javascript without assistance.
- Although basic I feel I gained a great deal from this, particularly JS altering CSS classes using classList.toggle() and classList.add

# cards.js

- Was coding at the same time following Colt Steele's Javascript course, wrote a little scripts playing with cards as part of his course.
- lots of playing and manipulating arrays
